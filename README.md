# Mekphen-s-Ambience-Area-System
As most of us know, sound is one of the most important roles in the immersiveness and realism of a game. Many maps in the workshop added little or no sound to their maps, so I created this addon

=== INFORMATION ===

With this addon you have the possibility to create your own zones with a sound file bound to the zone. You can upload music in an external content pack and use your own.
As soon as the zone is entered, an ad and a chat message will appear and the music / ambience will start to play slowly.
As soon as you leave the zone, you will receive an ad and a chat message again and the music will slowly stop playing.

=== FAQ ===

- How to add custom sounds? -

You need to create an content pack for your server, and put the sound into
addonfolder/sound/yoursound.ogg
The Path is for the AddSound command will then be "yoursound.ogg"


- Can you add a specific sound for me? -

Unfortunatly not. I will try to create some prepacked music packs,
which you then can add to your collection, like for star wars servers and stuff,
but most ambience track are over an hour and have an accordingly big size

- Where can i report a bug? -

Just reply under this addon. Please don't add me on steam,
unless i ask you to, or you wan't to ask for a reupload permission.
